# FlowModel
Code written 2000-2005 for my PhD thesis to apply a flow model to calculate distances from redshifts at cz&lt;3000km/s. 

The main code is in myflowmodelcall.f

Shared here in 2020 without any guarantee is still works OK - but the comments I wrote in 2000-2005 look sensible. 

Addition in 2022 - additional fortran files (coords.f, deltav.f, numericalrecipes.f and useful.f) are files which include some/most of the subroutines which are called in the main program. This was based on a deep search of my twenty-year old archives and has not been tested. Some of these are credit to other people (e.g. Numerical recipes), so be careful if you use them to give proper credit.
